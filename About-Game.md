Below is a simpler, step-by-step explanation of what’s happening in the code, written in easier language. This explanation assumes you understand the basics of programming and the concept of a blockchain, but it should still be understandable to someone in 10th grade.

## What Are We Doing?

We are creating a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** using a programming language called **Move**, which runs on the **Sui** blockchain. The code describes how to:

1. Represent a Tic-Tac-Toe game on the blockchain.
2. Control who can make moves.
3. Determine when the game is over and who won.
4. Give out "trophies" at the end of the game.

There are three different versions of this game:

1. **Centralized Game Board:** One special "admin" controls the game board, and players must ask the admin to place their moves.
2. **Shared Game Board:** No single admin. Both players can update the board directly, but the code still makes sure they take turns correctly.

## Concepts Used

- **Owned Objects:** In Sui, "objects" can hold data. An *owned* object belongs to a single person or account.
- **Shared Objects:** A *shared* object doesn’t belong to any single person and can be changed by multiple people (in our case, both players).
- **Dynamic Object Fields:** Storing objects inside other objects, like putting a "Mark" (player’s move) inside the "Game" object.

## The Game’s Data

To represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board, we have a `Game` object. It holds:

- A `board` which is basically a list of 9 slots (3x3). Each slot can be:
  - Empty
  - Marked with an X
  - Marked with an O
- Who are the two players (addresses on the blockchain).
- Whose turn it is.

For example:

```move
public struct Game has key, store {
    id: UID,
    board: vector<u8>, // 9 positions for our 3x3 board
    turn: u8,           // which turn number it is (0 to 9)
    x: address,         // the address of player X
    o: address,         // the address of player O
    admin: vector<u8>,  // (used in one version) public key of the admin
}
```

In the centralized version, `admin` is important. In the shared version, it’s not needed.

## How Moves Work in the Centralized Version

1. **Creating the Game:**
   When the game starts, we create a `Game` object and give the first player (X) a special token called a `TurnCap`. This `TurnCap` proves that it’s their turn to move.

   ```move
   public fun new(x: address, o: address, admin: vector<u8>, ctx: &mut TxContext): Game {
       let game = Game {
           id: object::new(ctx),
           board: vector[MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__, MARK__],
           turn: 0,
           x,
           o,
           admin,
       };

       let turn = TurnCap {
           id: object::new(ctx),
           game: object::id(&game),
       };

       // Give the turn to player X
       transfer::transfer(turn, x);
       game
   }
   ```

2. **Player Makes a Move:**
   Player X can then call `send_mark`. They say: "I want to put my mark at (row, col)". This doesn’t directly change the board. Instead, it creates a `Mark` object and sends it to the `Game` object. The `TurnCap` is taken away from them so they can't play twice in a row.

   ```move
   public fun send_mark(cap: TurnCap, row: u8, col: u8, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
       // Checks and creates a Mark object, sends it to the Game
   }
   ```

3. **Admin Places the Move:**
   The admin then confirms the move by calling `place_mark`, which takes the `Mark` from the game object and actually updates the board's data.

   ```move
   public fun place_mark(game: &mut Game, mark: Receiving<Mark>, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
       // Admin updates the board if valid.
       // If the game ends (someone wins or draw), trophies are handed out.
       // If not ended, gives the "TurnCap" to the other player for their turn.
   }
   ```

This means each move needs two transactions: one from the player (send_mark) and one from the admin (place_mark).

---

## The Shared Version (No Admin Needed)

In the shared version, the `Game` object is shared. Both players can directly call `place_mark` without needing an admin. The code checks who is calling, and only allows the correct player to move next.

```move
public fun place_mark(game: &mut Game, row: u8, col: u8, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // Make sure it's not finished and the move is valid
    // Check that the caller is the correct player
    // Place the mark on the board directly
}
```

Since the board is a *shared object*, we don't need an admin or a TurnCap object. The game itself ensures the correct player is making the move.

---

## Checking the Winner

After every move, the code checks if someone has won or if the board is full (a draw). If the game is over:

- If one player won, that player gets a "Trophy" object.
- If it's a draw, both players get a Trophy.

A Trophy is like a reward object given to the players at the end.

```move
if (end == TROPHY_WIN) {
    // give trophy to winner
} else if (end == TROPHY_DRAW) {
    // give trophies to both players
}
```

## Why Two Approaches?

- **Centralized version:** Faster and cheaper in some ways (because it uses owned objects), but needs someone (admin) to finalize moves.
- **Shared version:** Simpler in the sense that it’s just one transaction per move, but could be slightly more expensive to run (since shared objects cost more).

## Summary

- We are building a Tic-Tac-Toe game on Sui.
- A `Game` object holds the state of the board.
- Players take turns placing marks.
- The code ensures only the correct player can move at each step.
- When the game ends (win or draw), players get Trophies.
- We show two different styles:
  - **Centralized (Owned)**: Needs an admin to confirm moves.
  - **Shared (No Admin)**: Players make moves directly.

Both versions follow the same Tic-Tac-Toe logic, just handle control and ownership differently.
