## Code Snippets & Tutorials

### Move Smart Contract Example

```move
module 0x2::SimpleGame {
    struct Player has store {
        name: vector<u8>,
        score: u64,
    }

    public fun register_player(owner: &signer, name: vector<u8>) {
        let player = Player { name, score: 0 };
        move_to(owner, player);
    }

    public fun update_score(player: &mut Player, new_score: u64) {
        player.score = new_score;
    }

    public fun get_score(player: &Player): u64 {
        player.score
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Player Struct**: Represents a player with a name and score.
- **register_player**: Registers a new player.
- **update_score**: Updates the player's score.
- **get_score**: Retrieves the player's score.

### TypeScript Game Frontend Example

```typescript
import { JsonRpcProvider, RawSigner, Ed25519Keypair } from '@mysten/sui.js';

const provider = new JsonRpcProvider('https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io');
const keypair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(Uint8Array.from([/* your private key bytes */]));
const signer = new RawSigner(keypair, provider);

const PACKAGE_ID = '0xYourPackageID';

async function registerPlayer(name: string) {
    const nameBytes = Array.from(Buffer.from(name, 'utf-8'));
    const tx = await signer.executeMoveCall({
        packageObjectId: PACKAGE_ID,
        module: 'SimpleGame',
        function: 'register_player',
        typeArguments: [],
        arguments: [nameBytes],
        gasBudget: 1000,
    });
    await provider.waitForTransaction(tx.digest);
    console.log('Player registered:', tx.digest);
}

async function updatePlayerScore(newScore: number) {
    // Implementation for updating score
}

async function getPlayerScore(playerId: string) {
    // Implementation for getting score
}

// Example usage
registerPlayer('Alice');
```

**Explanation:**

- **registerPlayer**: Registers a player named "Alice".
- **PACKAGE_ID**: Replace `'0xYourPackageID'` with your actual published package ID.
- **Security Note**: Never expose your private keys. Use environment variables or secure key management systems.

### Deployment Tutorial

1. **Compile the Move Contract**:

    ```bash
    sui move build
    ```

2. **Publish the Contract**:

    ```bash
    sui move publish --path ./packages/simple_game --gas-budget 10000
    ```

3. **Deploy the Frontend**:
    - Host the TypeScript game using platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
    - Ensure the frontend interacts correctly with the deployed smart contracts.

## Conclusion

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of Web3 and blockchain fundamentals, hands-on experience with the Sui blockchain and Move programming language, and the skills to develop and deploy a simple game integrated with smart contracts. This project-based approach ensures that students not only learn the theoretical aspects but also apply them in a practical, engaging manner.
