## What is Sui?

Sui is a **Layer-1 blockchain** designed to provide a highly scalable, secure, and efficient platform for building decentralized applications (dApps). As a self-reliant blockchain, Sui manages its own consensus, execution, and security mechanisms, ensuring robust performance and reliability.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Layer-1 Blockchain**: Handles its own consensus, execution, and security without relying on other layers.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of finalizing transactions at lightning-fast speeds.
- **Predictable Costs**: Consistent and predictable transaction fees, essential for both developers and end-users.
- **Latency-Sensitive Applications**: Ideal for applications requiring quick responses, such as gaming and fast retail payments.

## Key Features

### 1. **Consensus and Ordering Mechanisms**

- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**: Ensures Sybil resistance by delegating staking power to trusted validators.
- **Narwhal & Bullshark**: Sui utilizes Narwhal for consensus and Bullshark for transaction ordering, enabling efficient and secure transaction processing.

### 2. **Object-Centric Data Model**

- **True Asset Ownership**: Assets like tokens and NFTs are represented as individual objects with ownership directly assigned, providing users with direct control without relying solely on smart contracts.

### 3. **Move Programming Language**

- **Security and Flexibility**: Move is an asset-centric language developed for blockchain use, emphasizing safety and resource management.
- **Move VM**: Executes Move smart contracts, ensuring secure and efficient contract operations.

## History of Sui

Sui's development is rooted in the **Libra/Diem project** initiated by Meta (formerly Facebook) around 2020. Although Meta discontinued the project due to regulatory challenges, five leaders from the original team—Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias—founded **Mysten Labs** to continue advancing the technology.

### Milestones:

- **2022**: Multiple testnet iterations to refine the network.
- **May 3, 2023**: Launch of Sui’s mainnet.
- **Ongoing**: Continuous advancements by Mysten Labs and a growing community of developers building on Sui.
